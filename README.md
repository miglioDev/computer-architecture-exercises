# Computer Architecture Exercises

This repository contains a collection of explained exercises on basic computer architecture topics, created during my first semester of Computer Science studies.

## About

The goal of this repository is to understand the fundamental concepts of how electronic devices work through exercises with clear explanations.
This guide is perfect for anyone who’s diving into the world of computer architecture! Whether you're a student or just someone brushing up on the basics, you'll find it helpful.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic:

- `01-binary-representation-and-operations`  
  Exercises on number systems, binary arithmetic, and basic memory concepts.

- `02-data-representation-and-encoding`  
  Character encoding, base conversions, and floating-point representation.

- `03-digital-circuits`  
  Boolean functions, truth tables, and minimal logic circuit implementations.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with exercises and detailed explanations.

## How to Use

You can navigate through the exercises using the menu to go directly to topics of interest. 
Remember, it is better to actively try the exercises rather than just reading how to do them! Each exercise includes a solution and an explanation.
