# Computer Architecture Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises and explained notes on core computer architecture topics, created during my first year of Computer Science studies.

## About

The goal of this repository is to reinforce fundamental concepts by combining exercises with clear, step-by-step explanations.
It is intended for students studying computer architecture or reviewing its basics through practical examples.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic:

- `01-binary-representation-and-operations`  
  Exercises on number systems, binary arithmetic, and basic memory concepts.

- `02-data-representation-and-encoding`  
  Character encoding, base conversions, and floating-point representation.

- `03-digital-circuits`  
  Boolean functions, truth tables, and minimal logic circuit implementations.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with exercises and detailed explanations.

## How to Use

You can follow the sections in order or jump directly to a specific topic.
Each exercise is accompanied by a solution and reasoning to support learning and revision.
